<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Subtext.</p>
<p>
  We took the liberty of creating some sample introductory content for you, 
  <em>but feel free to delete it at any time by logging into the <a href="{1}" title="Blog Admin">admin 
  section</a></em>.
</p>
<p>
    A blog post is the primary content for a blog and tend to be chronologically 
    ordered. Some blog posts are timeless, but most are transient. Unless you specify 
    otherwise, blog posts show up in your RSS feed.
</p>
<p>
    If you click on the title of the blog post, you can view comments left for that 
    post. Go ahead, try it.
</p>
<p>
    We also created <a href="{0}" title="an article">a sample article</a> for you.
</p>
<h3>Two important links for your blog.</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{1}" title="Blog Admin">Your Blog&#8217;s Admin section</a></li>
    <li><a href="{2}" title="Blog Host Admin">Your Blog&#8217;s Host Admin section</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Login to the Admin section of the site to create new blog posts, categories, etc.
