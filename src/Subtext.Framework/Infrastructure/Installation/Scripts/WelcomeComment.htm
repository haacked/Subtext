Hey there. It&#8217;s a brand new installation and already you have a comment!
</p>
<p>
When you are logged in as an Admin, a <em>Remove Comment</em> link shows up next 
to the comment making it very easy to delete the comment right from the blog post.
</p>
<p>
You can also moderate comments centrally from the 
<a href="{0}" title="Feedback Tool">Feedback tool in the admin section</a>.
